# Getting started
To contribute to this project:
  - minor contribution (typo/minor change): you can use github's [edit feature](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files) & make a PR.
  - clone it locally, have [github pages gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) installed & run jekyll, for example `jekyll -w serve`. Hack on it, commit-push-make a PR.
